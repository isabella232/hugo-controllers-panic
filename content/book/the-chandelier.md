_The Chandelier_, written when Lispector was only twenty-three, reveals a very different author from the college student whose debut novel, _Near to the Wild Heart_, announced the landfall of "Hurricane Clarice." Virgínia and her cruel, beautiful brother, Daniel, grow up in a decaying country mansion. They leave for the city, but the change of locale leaves Virgínia’s internal life unperturbed. In intensely poetic language, Lispector conducts a stratigraphic excavation of Virgínia’s thoughts, revealing the drama of Clarice’s lifelong quest to discover “the nucleus made of a single instant”—and displaying a new face of this great writer, blazing with the vitality of youth.
