A traffic jam outside Paris lasts for weeks. Che Guevara and Fidel Castro meet on a mountaintop during the Cuban Revolution. A flight attendant becomes obsessed with a small Greek island, resulting in a surreal encounter with death. In _All Fires the Fire_, Julio Cortázar (author of _Hopscotch_ and the short story “Blow-Up”) creates his own mindscapes beyond space and time, where lives intersect for brief moments and situations break and refract. _All Fires the Fire_ contains some of Julio Cortázar’s most beloved stories. It is a classic collection by “one of the world’s great writers” (_Washington Post_).
