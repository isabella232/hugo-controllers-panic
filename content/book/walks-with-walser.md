After a nervous breakdown in 1929, Robert Walser spent the remaining twenty-seven years of his life in mental asylums. In 1936, Carl Seelig <span class="st">—</span> an admirer who became Walser’s friend and eventually his literary executor<span class="st">—</span>began accompanying the great Swiss writer on his daily walks. As they strolled, Walser told stories, shared his daily experiences of the sanatorium, and expressed his opinions about books and art, writing and history. Filled with lively anecdotes and details, _Walks With Walser_ offers the fullest available account of this wonderful writer’s inner and outer life.
