Death has come to the small village of Dodder to deliver a parchment with the names of two local mortals and the fatal word _unclay_ upon it. When he loses the precious sheet, he is free of his errand. Hungry to taste the sweet fruits of human life, Mr. John Death, as he is now known, takes a holiday in Dorsetshire and rests from his reaping. The village basks in summer loveliness but teems with all the old sins (lust, avarice, greed)â€”as well as loving-kindness. What unfolds is a witty, metaphysical, and surprising novel aglow with beauty and moral force.
