Part spy novel, part romance, part Henry James, _Your Face Tomorrow_ is a wholly remarkable display of the immense gifts of Javier Marias. With _Fever and Spear_, Volume One of his unfolding novel _Your Face Tomorrow_, he returns us to the rarified world of Oxford (the delightful setting of _All Souls_ and _Dark Back of Time_), while introducing us to territory entirely new—espionage. Our hero, Jaime Deza, separated from his wife in Madrid, is a bit adrift in London until his old friend Sir Peter Wheeler--retired Oxford don and semi-retired master spy—recruits him for a new career in British Intelligence. Deza possesses a rare gift for seeing behind the masks people wear. He is soon observing interviews conducted by Her Majesty’s secret service: variously shady international businessmen one day, would-be coup leaders the next. Seductively, this metaphysical thriller explores past, present, and future in the ever-more-perilous 21st century. This compelling and enigmatic tour de force from one of Europe’s greatest writers continues with _Volume Two: Dance and Dream._
