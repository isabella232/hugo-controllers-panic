Poet, monk, mystic, and social critic, Thomas Merton is a unique—and uniquely beloved—figure of the twentieth century, and _Silence, Joy_ brings together his best-loved poems and prose. Drawn from classics like _New Seeds of Contemplation_ and _The Way of Chuang Tzu_ as well as less famous books, the writings in _Silence, Joy_ offer the reader deep, calming stillness, flights of ecstatic praise, steadying words of wisdom, and openhearted laughter. Manna for Merton lovers and a warm embrace for novices, this slim collection is a delightful gift.
