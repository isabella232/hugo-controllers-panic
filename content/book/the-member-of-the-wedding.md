Winner of the New York Drama Critics Circle Award: at the suggestion of her friend Tennessee Williams, Southern writer Carson McCullers adapted her novella _The Member of the Wedding_ into a touching and poignant play that was an enormous success when it opened on Broadway in 1950, and has long since become a classic of the American theater. With compassion, veracity and wit, in _The Member of the Wedding_ Carson McCullers depicts the intrinsically enmeshed lives of whites and blacks in the American South. Julie Harris became a star playing the awkward, twelve-year-old tomboy Frankie Adams, who falls deeply in love with her older brother and his fiancé. Exhilarated by her naïve conviction that being a member of their wedding means she will become what she calls the "we of me," Frankie is devastated when she learns she is not invited on the honeymoon. Bernice Sadie Brown, who has experienced a lifetime of love and loss, is a surrogate mother for Frankie. Portrayed on stage and in the film versions by the great Ethel Waters, Bernice is an epic character, fiercely loyal, down-to-earth, and centered by deep faith.
