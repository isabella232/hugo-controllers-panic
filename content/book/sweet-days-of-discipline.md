  description: "**_Dipped in the blue ink of adolescence, Fleur Jaeggy's pen is an
    engraver's needle depicting roots, twigs, and branches of the tree of madness,
    growing in the splendid isolation of the small Swiss garden of knowledge into
    full leaf until it obscures every perspective. Extraordinary prose. Reading time
    is approximately four hours. Remembering time, as for its authors: the rest of
    one's life._—Joseph Brodsky** "

A novel about obsessive love and madness set in postwar Switzerland, Fleur Jaeggy’s eerily beautiful novel begins  innocently enough: "At fourteen I was a boarder in a school in the Appenzell." But there is nothing innocent here. With the offhanded remorselessness of a young Eve, the narrator describes her potentially lethal designs to win the affections of Frédérique, the apparently perfect new girl. In Tim Parks’s consummate translation with its "spare, haunting quality of a prose poem" (_TLS_), _Sweet Days of Discipline_ is a peerless, terrifying, and gorgeous work.
