Published in 1965, Charles Reznikoffâ€™s _Testimony: The United States 1885-1890 Recitative_ is a unique and historical document. This extraordinary poetic work, the first volume of a projected series of five, reflects in verse the social, economic, cultural, and legal history of the United States and its people from 1885 to 1890. Drawing on actual court records of this period, Charles Reznikoff, who was an attorney, produced a superb portrayal of life in our nation.
