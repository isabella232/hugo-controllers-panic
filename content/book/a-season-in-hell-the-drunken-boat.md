New Directions is pleased to announce the relaunch of the long-celebrated bilingual edition of Rimbaud’s _A Season In Hell & The Drunken Boat_ — a personal poem of damnation as well as a plea to be released from “the examination of his own depths.” Rimbaud originally distributed _A Season In Hell_ to friends as a self-published booklet, and soon afterward, at the age of nineteen, quit poetry altogether. New Directions’ edition was among the first to be published in the U.S., and quickly became a classic. Rimbaud’s famous poem “The Drunken Boat” was subsequently added to the first paperbook printing. Allen Ginsberg proclaimed Arthur Rimbaud as “the first punk” — a visionary mentor to the Beats for both his recklessness and his fiery poetry. This new edition proudly dons the original Alvin Lustig designed cover, and a introduction by another famous rebel — and now National Book Award-winner — Patti Smith.
