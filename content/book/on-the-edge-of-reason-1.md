Until the age of fifty-two, the protagonist of _On the Edge of Reason_ suffered a monotonous existence as a highly respected lawyer. he owned a carriage and wore a top hat. He lived the life of "an orderly good-for-nothing among a whole crowd of neat, gray good-for-nothings." But, one evening, surrounded by ladies and gentlemen at a party, he hears the Director-General tell a lively anecdote of how he shot four men like dogs for trespassing on his property. 

Written in 1938, _On the Edge of Reason_ reveals the fundamental chasm between conformity and individuality. As folly piles upon folly, hypocrisy upon hypocrisy, reason itself begins to give way, and edge between reality and unreality disappears.
