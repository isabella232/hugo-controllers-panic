“I want you to know that I’m not a critic or theorist"—so begins the first of eight classes that the great Argentine writer Julio Cortázar delivered at UC Berkeley in 1980. These classes are as much reflections on Cortázar’s own writing—"in my work I look for solutions as problems arise"—as musings about literature. He covers such topics as “the writer’s path” (“while my aesthetic world view made me admire writers like Borges, I was able to open my eyes to the language of street slang, _lunfardo_”) and _the fantastic_ (“unbeknownst to me, the fantastic had become as acceptable, as possible and real, as the fact of eating soup at eight o’clock in the evening”), _Literature Class_ provides the amazingly warm and personal experience of sitting in a room with this fantastically inventive author. As Joaquin Marco stated in _El Cultural_, “exploring this course is to dive into Cortázar designing his own creations.... Essential for anyone reading or studying Cortázar, cronopio or not!”
