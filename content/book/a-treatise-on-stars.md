“My book describes how communicating with star beings can teach us to continue our world through love and grace, communal grace.” —Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, “Chaco and Olivia”

_A Treatise on Stars_ extends Mei-mei Berssenbrugge's intensely phenomenological poetics to the fiery bodies in a “field of heaven...outside spacetime." Long, lyrical lines map a geography of interconnected, interdimensional intelligence that exists in all places and sentient beings. These are poems of deep listening and patient waiting, open to the cosmic loom, the channeling of daily experience and conversation, gestalt and angels, dolphins and a star-visitor beneath a tree. Family, too, becomes a type of constellation, a thought "a form of organized light." All of our sense are activated by Berssenbrugge's radiant lines, giving us a poetry of keen perception grounded in the physical world, where "days fill with splendor, and earth offers its pristine beauty to an expanding present."
