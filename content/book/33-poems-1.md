The American poet Robert Lax belongs to the generation of Thomas Merton, Beat poetry, Abstract Expressionism, and the compositions of John Cage. Yet he stands out as this era’s most intriguing minimalist poet, gaining this reputation through a constant questioning of the universe and our idea about it. His poetry varies from fables and parables to clear-cut columns of words, from his account of a day at the circus as a vision of creation to his own insistent and mystical search for truth.

_33 Poems_ presents the quintessential gathering of Lax’s work, including _Sea & Sky_ and _The Circus of the Sun_, “perhaps the greatest English-language poem of this century” (_The New York Times_).
